	abstract = "<B>Background:</B> Accurate patient identification (PT ID) is a key component in hospital patient safety practices and was addressed by one of the first six Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals, which were introduced in 2003. Although the literature on patient safety practices is replete with discussion of strategies for improvement, less is known about frontline providers' subjective views. A qualitative study was conducted to examine the subjective views and experiences of nurses and residents regarding PT ID at an urban teaching hospital.<P></P> <B>Methods:</B> Some 15 registered nurses and 15 residents were interviewed between August 2009 and June 2010. Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative methodologies.<P></P> <B>Findings:</B> Although residents and nurses viewed PT ID as crucial to patient safety, they cited time pressures; confidence in their ability to informally identify patients; and a desire to deliver personal, humanistic care as reasons for not consistently verifying patient identification. Nurses expressed concern about annoying, offending, and/or alienating patients by repeatedly checking wristbands and asking date of birth, in the belief that excessive patient identification practices could undermine trust. Residents relied on nurses to check ID and preferred to greet the patient by name, a practice that they viewed as more consistent with their professional identity. Referring to patients by their room number and location was cited as a commonly used practice of PT ID and a contributor to errors in identification.<P></P> <B>Conclusions:</B> Nurses and residents are aware of the importance and requirements to verify PT ID, but their adherence is mitigated by a variety of factors, including assessment of necessity or risk, impact on their relationship with the patient, and practices in place in the hospital environment that protect patient privacy.",

abstract = "Medication use in hospitals is a complex process and is dependent on the successful interaction of health professionals functioning within different disciplines. Errors can occur at any one of the five main stages of prescribing, documenting, dispensing or preparation, administering and monitoring. The responsibility for the error is often placed on the nurse, as she or he is the last person in the drug administration chain whilst more pressing underlying causal factors remain unresolved.

This paper demonstrates how hierarchical task analysis can be used to model drug administration and then uses the systematic human error reduction and prediction approach to predict which errors are likely to occur. The paper also puts forward design solutions to mitigate these errors."
